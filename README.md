#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a discpline of desiigning, developing,testing and maintaining software appliations.The importance in terms of technology industry is that its scalable,innovative ,quality assuarence and does satsify's customers.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Structured programming that was introduced in 1960s-1970s as aresponse to the growing complexity and the need for more reliable and maintanance code.
2.  Object Oriented Programming that was introduced in 1980s where software is organized around "objects" rather than actions.
3.  The rise of Agile methodologies in 2000s,that emphasizes iterative development,with continous customer feedback and adaption to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements
2. Design: Creating high level and detailed designs  ofsoftware architecture and user interface
3. Implementation:writng code and +building the software according to thedesign specification
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards
5. Deployment: Realising softwares to the customers.
6. Maintanance: Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the softwares

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distict phases for example: Two companies developing a CRM system and company A follows waterfall which is a linear process with little flexibility after the initial reqirement phase,which can lead to delays and higher costs if changes are needed later while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration,an d responding to change for example: Company B in developing CRM system uses agile aproach where it is all about  to delivers working software in increments,allowing the client to provide feedback throughout the process. This results in a product that is more closely and matches the client's needs and can adapt to changes more quickly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: is responsible for writing,testing and maintaning the code that makesup a software application.The responsibilities are:coding and implementation,collaboration,code review,Testing and debugging,documentation.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: is responsible for ensuring the software meets the quality standardsbeforeit is released to the users. The responsibilities are: Test planning, Manual and Automated testing,Bug reporting and track,regression testing,quality metrics, collaboration.
3. Project manager: is responsible for planning, executing and closing projects. The responsibilities includes: Project planning,resource management,Stakeholder communication,Risk management,Budget management and Team Leadership.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are softwares that provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code for example : Visual studio. VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members  for example: Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing complexrequirements which are either ambigous,or ptone to frequent changes.Thiscan be solved by clear documentation,rugular communicationand use of Agile methodologies.
2. Time management and meeting deadlines: this can be solved by prioritizing,use time management tools like Trello,Asana and breakdown the tasks.
3. Debugging and Troubleshooting which is time consuming fir identifying and fixing a bug: this can be solved by systematic debbugging ,peer review s and automated error reporting.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing: involves testing individual components of a software application in isolation. The importance is for early bug dectation,and code quality.
2. Intergration testing: focuses on verifying the interactions between different units or components of the software.The importance if for detecting interface issues,ensure cahasion and validation of data flow
3. System testing: Involves testing the complete ,intergrated system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.The importance include: End-to End Verification,identifies detects,simulates real world scenarios.
4. Acceptance testing: is conducted to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deliveray to end-users. The importance includes: Customer satsifaction,validates business requirements and final approval.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process of crafting instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistants. This improves  efficiency,enhance responce clarity and minimizes the misunderstanding.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt: "state the importance of AI"
Improved prompt: "State the importance of AI in health sector for Africans in 2024.
